# Minimal SD card image for the Freescale iMX8 boards which is
# partitioned according to Mender requirements to perform A/B style updates.
#
# We mimic the .sdcard Freescale's image format:
# * the SD card must have 33 kB free space at the beginning,
# * U-Boot is integrated into imx8-boot-sd.bin and is dumped as is,
# * dual filesystem partitions are required
# * data partition where all persistent state is stored, this is created
#   based on content of the /data directory in rootfs.
